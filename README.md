## ⚙️ Customization Options

- Use the slider to adjust password length (from 8 to 20).
- Check the **Numbers** box to include digits (0–9).
- Check the **Character** box to include symbols like `!@#$%^&*(){}`.
- Click the **Copy** button to copy the generated password to your clipboard.

## 💡 How It Works

The password is generated by randomly selecting characters from a string that changes based on your selected options (letters, numbers, symbols).  
It uses `useState`, `useCallback`, and `useEffect` hooks from React to manage and update the password whenever options are changed.  
A `useRef` is used to copy the generated password to the clipboard.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Add a password strength indicator  
- Show a “Copied!” tooltip on copy  
- Save user preferences in localStorage  
- Add dark/light mode toggle
